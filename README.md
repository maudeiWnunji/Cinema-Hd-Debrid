# Cinema Hd Debrid
  
Hi, I seem to be having an issue with Real-Debrid and WebDAV content. When infuse scans for changes it comes back with a different number for Movies and TV Episodes each time. Not sure why this is the case.
 
With stremio it has a Netflix like interface, every movie and show that exists. You link your real debrid account and basically as soon as you play a movie or show it gets added to your real debrid torrent folder.

glad to see others running into the same issue. every once in a huge chunk of my library (/torrents folder) is gone from Infuse on AppleTV. restoring the icloud backup just pulled me back from 80 to 132 movies.
 
If you are an avid cord-cutter you have likely heard the term real-debrid but may be wondering just exactly what it is and how it works. In general terms, real-debrid is a platform that provides streaming links on media outlets such as Kodi Addons or APKs.
 
You may have used these options in the past to watch VOD content but felt disappointed with the streams provided that may not be in high definition quality or seem to buffer/lag during playback. This is where real-debrid comes in.
 
Most cord-cutters use this platform with their Amazon Firestick or Android/Google TV Box in conjunction with free Kodi add-ons or streaming apps. We provide instructions for adding this service to both in the guide below.
 
Files links that Users download are stored in a database for legal concerns and our internal use. All saved links are erased within 1 month for security reasons and service needs. However all requests made on our site are stored for 1 year, the legal retention period.
 
Below, you will find a general outline for registering anonymously for a Real-Debrid account. **Please refer to the video above for important details not found in the instructions below.**

**1.** Prior to visiting the Real-Debrid signup page, first **connect to Surfshark** which is a compatible VPN. You can do this on PC, Mac, phone or tablet. Keep in mind that you can use your Surfshark account on unlimited devices and they provide applications for everything.
 
We suggest using addons instead of the free streaming apps for a few reasons. First, you will enjoy your movies and TV shows without annoying ads. Second, you will usually get more 4K and 1080P links within Kodi.
 
App users will be able to view films and series via direct links that are scraped from the internet. However, those of us who use real-debrid can integrate this platform for even higher-quality source options.
 
Yes, this premium service is 100% legal to use. However, some content you access may be illegal. To ensure you are abiding by copyright laws, make sure to only watch movies and TV shows within the public domain.
 
Real debrid is really good that is not the problem.
There is something else wrong.
What firestick do you have?
Try seeing if there is a software update for the firestick.
What version kodi ya using?
Clear cache or even clear data and start from scratch.
Try the latest kodi 20.1
It could be a number of things, i was constantly getting kicked out of kodi 20 on my firestick.
 
I saw the recently posted article about the privacy concerns with real Real-Debrid. However, this information is not new. It has been there for a very very long time. Why is it suddenly an issue now? Nobody reads fine print anymore I guess.
 
I would recommend transferring all of your cryptocurrency to a crypto wallet. And then washing it through a Bitcoin tumbler if you are using Bitcoin and pay with the tumbled Bitcoin. Otherwise, exchange your cryptocurrency for Monero coins. Monero coin is proven truly anonymous. Then transfer your Monero coin to a Litecoin (LTC) address not associated or connected to your Coinbase account or your real identity. Real-Debrid accepts Litecoin cryptocurrency. Litecoin transactions are cheaper and faster than Bitcoin.
 
Thanks for clarifying Troy! Someone in here said the CashApp still had low Bitcoin fees, so I assumed it was just Coinbase. Makes me feel better to hear you say it should be just temporary. It is my preferred way to pay now.
 
Apologies if asked. I looked around and couldnt seem to find topic about my question. If i link my real debrid with kodi, do i also have to link real debrid with every add on i add to kodi, or does linking it with kodi automatically link it to add ons within kodi? Hope this makes sense.
 
Just went to Real Debrid to renew my subscription and Coinbase is not available for payment with crypto. Coingate is the exchange listed and it is not available to US citizens. I did use Startmail previously and would like to keep Surfshark VPN on to keep my IP address private. I did not see an opportunity to use a wallet either. I will probably use a pre-paid debit card, because I can not give up Real Debrid. Hope someone has another option.
 
@JPM69 @MarkxG Haha So happy you are not mad. And I will definitely take a look at the Account Manager App. Have also calendered (it there a word like that ) the renewal for Nov. Dang, I could not understand all of a sudden my streaming thingies are all messed up
 
I learn as i go and make plenty of mistakes. I give information based on my own experiences. I dont know the how most of this all works on the inside but i learned some things with trial and error. Mostly error.
 
Hi Team. I have a real debrid account and have it on one of my apps.  
I am trying to put it on Kodi / Promice, but the code shown on the screen is not being accepted.  
I am usings my Chrome account on my phone to save time but still no luck.  
Any other ideas.?
 
Hello. I have real debrid and a vpn. I notice that I get ads on my Home Screen. I have to wait for the cycle of 2 ads before I can go into any streaming app. Can you tell me how I can avoid those annoying ads? Thanks very much
 
Hi Troy , been wondering what all the fuss was about real debrid and your article was very informative, thank you. Does this work on streaming English premier league and champions league games as well as fa cup caraboa cup and pre season friendlies as well or does it only work on streaming movies and tv shows ? Best Regards, Dan
 
Hello Just purchased a Real-Debrid account for a month & walked myself thru logging in properly After I got & logged into done my credentials are not showing in the top left hand corner of the screen.when logging into FilmPlus or Flixzoid as well. It just says Clear Real-Debrid credentials. I am using Proton VPN. Maybe its not compatable?
 
Some kodi addons and others have a time out if you dont put in the code to your real debrid fast enough, my advice would be to sign into your real debrid from a phone and as soon as the code appears put it in. You will get it. :)
 
hi i have a problem with downloader. you see i did a factory reset on 1 0f my firesticks . now my 3 firesticks downloader wont work. i have tried everything and still downloader wont work. is there any thing you can suggest..
 
A new version of Cinema HD has finally been released with **V3** now available for installation on nearly any device. With this update comes some new features that users should take note of before using.
 
We provide instructions below for doing this on both Firestick and Android/Google TV but we should note that you should always connect to a trusted VPN before allowing app developers access to your storage files/data.
 
You must allow storage permission in order to use the app as prompted in this message. We can easily do so within the settings of our device and provide instructions for Firestick and Android/Google TV below.
 
After installing Cinema HD on your Firestick or Android TV device, most users integrate premium services to improve their streaming experience. This includes Real-Debrid, Trakt, and external video players.
 
Browsing for and selecting content is a simple process with tons of categories and genres to choose from. Upon selecting your viewing choice, the application provides you with numerous sources. Oftentimes, these are in 720, 1080p, and even 4K.
 
i was having issues with my Cinema app as i was no longer finding streams. So I followed the instructions on the Troypoint.com site and cannot get cinema to download. it said that I needed to delete the previous version, which I did and then tried again. I click the download button and the download stays at 0% and does not advance. What am I missing?
 
Get a Trakt.tv account (free) set up. Log in to Track in the Cinema setting, and it will gather all your history. When you install or reinstall any app (on any device), then in the app log back into your tracktv, if will then load back in all your favorites, history etc.
 
I have loaded Real-debrid on more apps and on more devices than I can remember. Since 2.4 - 3.0 Real-Debrid has never connected on any version of Cinema. Also on Apktime only the Official version would install.
 
Downloaded the original amd its loaded with adds even with surfshark, also it keep the other version, dont like allbthebadds so have deleted it again amd using flixvision this is far superior and much better than Cinema HD, flixvision wins hands down for me
 
Saw there was an update to cinema hd. Is there a way to just update my current version so as to not lose my favorites data? When on the APKTime app version 3.03 does not have an official tag by it and it says to remove old cinema app first.
 
Got a new firestick 4K max, loaded it up with CinemaHD 3.0.9 and MX player as I have done on 3 other firesticks and when I exit a stream, the screen goes grey and I have to force close both MX player and CinemaHD. I tried VLC player with CinemaHD and it did the same thing. The built in CinemaHD player seems to work without issue, but that player has had buffering issues in the past. Any thoughts on why this may be happening on the new 4k max?
